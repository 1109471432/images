== Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge

We don't build ready to use images for these browsers because of Windows license limitations. However we provide detailed instructions on building such images https://github.com/aerokube/windows-images[here]. The same approach can be used for preparing images with Firefox, Chrome and Opera under Windows.
